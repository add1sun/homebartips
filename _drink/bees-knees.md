You've probably heard the phrase "the bee's knees" for something that is great, and that is definitely the intent behind the name of this drink. It was created during prohibition as a way to help cover up the nasty taste and smell of the rotgut bathtuub gin of the the times. Today, it is just a lovely cocktail in its own right.

## Recipe

*Served up, 3.5 oz.*

- 2 oz. gin
- .75 oz. lemon juice
- .75 oz. honey syrup
- garnish: lemon twist


Shake all ingredients with ice, strain and serve. Garnish with some freshly cracked black pepper if you want to be cheeky.
