Punch comes to us from British sailors returning from India. They had picked up a refreshing drink that mixed liquor with fruit juice, sugar, and water, with spices or tea. It became quite the craze back in the 18th century and was spread across Europe and the Americas. In Europe, they tended to use brandy for punch, but in the US rum was more available, being locally produced. Punches are, for the most part, simple yet very tasty drinks, and most recipes are designed to be made in large quantities for sharing from a bowl.
