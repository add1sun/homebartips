This drink has a laundry list of ingredients and the only one with alcohol is the gin. It has a storied history, coming from New Orleans in the 1880s. It is a drink that bartenders tend to hate as well. Not because it isn't a great drink, beacuse it is truly delicious, but because it is a pain to make. To achieve the correct consistency it needs to be shaken for minutes instead of seconds. Bartenders sometimes pass the shaker around to give each other a rest when making one, or use shaker machines to do the heavy lifting. Really, try shaking a drink for 2 minutes and your arms want to fall off, not to mention your hands freezing to the arctic shaker. Why all the shaking? It has both cream and egg whites in it and you are essentially making whipped cream and eggs into a drink, whipping them in the shaker. I almost always go lazy and shake for about 1 minute before giving up. But regardless of how long you shake, it is worth it. Creamy, slightly sweet, but with a lovely citrus, lemon-lime flavor that makes it refreshing.

## Recipe

*Served on the rocks in a highball, 5 oz.*

- 1 1/2 oz. gin
- .75 oz simple syrup
- .5 oz. fresh lemon juice
- .5 oz. fresh lime juice
- 1 egg white
- 1 oz. heavy cream
- 3 drops orange flower water
- top: 1 oz. soda water, chilled

Dry shake (without ice) all of the ingredients, except the soda water. To get the creamiest, frothiest result you should give this at least 2 minutes of shaking, up to 5 minutes. Strain into a highball filled with ice and top with soda water. Add a straw and enjoy.
