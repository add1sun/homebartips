Basically you have a gin lemonade, and it's lovely. There are all kinds of stories about how it got its name, and I'll let the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB118012861703515126) provide some history for you. You can also find many variations on the Tom Collins, with other names that represent swapping out the main spirit, like John Collins is whiskey, and Juan Collins is tequila. As with most drinks you should play with the lemon juice to syrup ratio to get the flavor you like.

## Recipe

*Build on the rocks in a collins glass, 5 oz.*

- 2 oz. gin
- .5 oz. lemon
- 1 tsp simple syrup
- soda water
- garnish: lemon slice or lemon twist

Fill the glass with ice, then build the ingredients over the ice using the soda water to fill the glass.
