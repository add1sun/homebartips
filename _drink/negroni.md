If you like strong drinks with a nice herbal taste and some clean sharpness, the Negroni is classic. It is great as an apperitif to cleanse the palate. It comes from around 1900, and is reputedly a recipe that was made upon special request for Count Negroni, when we wanted his regular drink made stronger. The Negroni is made from equal parts Gin, Campari and Vermouth, with the Campari giving it the main apperatif bitterness. If you want the flavors of the drink, but not so much alcohol, you can always replace the gin with soda water, and you'll be back to the count's original drink, the Americano.
