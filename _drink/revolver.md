The Revolver is a modern drink that hits a really nice balance. I think of it as an Old Fashioned, served up, and with a coffee twist to it. It was created by bartender Jon Santer around 2003. It's nice and boozy with a solid bourbon backbone, and uses coffee liqueur (like Kahlua or Tia Maria) for the sweetness to take the edge off. The original recipe uses Bulleit bourbon, because ya know, you put bullets in revolvers. The orange bitters brings it up to a classic cocktail ingredient list&nbsp;and that, combined with the orange twist, gives it a fun Tootsie Roll aroma.
