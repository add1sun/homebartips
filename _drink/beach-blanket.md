This is a simple, sweet drink that doesn't have much history. I came across it randomly in Robert Hess' *[The Essential Bartender's Guide](http://amzn.to/1o6stEu)*. He states there that it was created by Francesco Lafranconi for the Hard Rock Cafe in Tampa. Most people associate J채germeister with J채gerbombs and crazy nights. It is actually not very strong at 35% ABV and, while called a potable bitter, these days is has been sweetened quite a bit and I consider it more of an herbal liqueur. It actually blends very nicely into a number of drinks. The Beach Blanket is sweet and rich, so it works nicely as dessert drink with some complexity in the flavors. 

## Recipe

- 1 oz. J채germeister
- 1 oz. coffee liqueur
- 1 oz. raspberry liqueur
