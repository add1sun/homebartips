This drink came about because I wanted to bring a cocktail to an Australia Day party. I Googled around a bit to find something appropriately Australian, and came across a few different recipes and mentions of a Pavlova cocktail, named after the ubiquitous Aussie&nbsp;dessert. The recipes I had were similar but there were definitely different takes on it or had specialty liqueurs that I wasn't likely to buy just for this, so I decided to play around and find what I liked. Pavlova is a meringue served with fruitâ€”commonly fruit like strawberries, passionfruit, and kiwi. So&nbsp;we have some fruit, which is pretty straightforward, and I would say the passionfruit is definitely the main flavor you get, while the strawberry adds a really nice color.&nbsp;I also liked the idea of getting some meringue-ish flavors&nbsp;by using Galliano, which adds some&nbsp;vanilla. That led me to riffing a bit on the [Yellow Bird cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Bird_(cocktail)). I would normally make a&nbsp;drink like this with an egg white to get some of the foamy meringue effect, but as I was taking this to a party, I wanted to make it as a batch ahead of time to simplify things. I opted to serve the drink with a floating mini meringue for a garnish instead. (I used [this meringue recipe](http://www.bhg.com/recipe/cookies/raspberry-meringues/), but with strawberry jam to match the strawberry in the drink.)
