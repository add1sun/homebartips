In this first episode I introduce the show, explain why I've started this podcast and what you can expect from it. I also introduce a regular feature on the show, which is the episode drink. We're starting things off with the lovely, iconic Martini.

## Cocktail Companion: Martini

This is an iconic drink that has been destroyed by the flavored vodka world. I'm going to leave that alone and just move on. The modern age has also dried Martinis out to the point where you are pretty much just getting a chilled shot of gin. While I like gin, the Martini is such a better cocktail than that.

The Dry Martini uses dry (French) vermouth, which is the classic that people refer to today, and is the original concoction. You also have the Sweet Martini as well though. It just uses sweet (Italian) vermouth instead. For completeness, there is also the modern Perfect Martini, called a Medium Martini back in the day, which uses equal parts dry and sweet vermouth.
