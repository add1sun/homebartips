Let's talk about bar equipment. What do you really need? It's probably less than you think. In this first of 2 parts about bar equipment I'm going to talk about these "minimum" items and how you can handle that with common kitchen items:

- A drinking container.
- A shaker.
- A stirrer.
- A strainer.
- A measure.
