I'm going to dive into cocktail ingredients by starting off with good, hard liquor. I'm going to talk about the "big 6" basic kinds that you find in most bars; what they are made from and some classic drinks made from them. The big 6 categories in this episode are:

- Gin
- Whisk(e)y
- Rum
- Brandy
- Tequila
- Vodka
