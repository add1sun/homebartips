In this episode I'm joined by my friend Nanda, who is a hardcore gin lover, to talk about this divine juniper concoction that we in the cocktail world love so much. We cover some history, gin styles, and how many bottles of gin Nanda has in her home bar. We also talk about a few books for more information about gin:

- [Gin: The Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Gin-Manual-Dave-Broom/dp/184533938X) by Dave Broom
