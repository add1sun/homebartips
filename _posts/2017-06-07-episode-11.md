This is a quick special episode that Nanda and I did in honor of [Negroni Week](https://negroniweek.com/), which is an annual charity event, running June 5–11 this year. We didn't do any fundraising but we did enjoy a couple of lovely Negronis, while we chatted about the history of the drink and some of our favorite variations. We made reference to a number resources in the podcast as well:
