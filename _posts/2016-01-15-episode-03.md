title: Episode 3 - Basic Bar Equipment for Cocktails
---

In the last episode I talked about how to get started with bartending with common kitchen equipment. Today I'm going to talk about the basics of standard bar equipment. While kitchen items work great, a few special bar items can make things a little nicer to work with, and well, you can also look a little more badass.
