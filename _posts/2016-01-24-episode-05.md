In today's episode I'm going to talk about one way of trying out new drinks. I have these little shindigs that I call Cocktail Labs and I just wanted to talk about what they are, why I do them, and some tips for how I do them if you want to have your own.

The 5 points I covered in this episode:

1. Make the drinks in advance and chill in the fridge until ready.
1. Small serving sizes of about half to 1 ounce means 1 regular cocktail recipe with serve several people easily.
1. Have a selection of 4â€“6 drinks, themed or not.
1. Let people take notes, and rate them if you want to measure which one comes out on top.
1. Provide food and water to cleanse the palate, but also just to be more fun and relaxed.
