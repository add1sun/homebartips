I've been playing with drinks at home for a few years now. It started with just a nice bottle of scotch to sip on occasionally, then turned into a well-stocked home bar and an enjoyable hobby making all kinds of cocktail recipes on regular basis. I've never worked in a bar, though I enjoy learning tricks of the trade as I come across them. A lot of the bartending information out there is focused on professional bartenders, and I've learned a lot from them. Since I'm not doing this professionally though, I wanted to create a resource for people like me, who want to nerd out on the world of drinks at home without getting too wrapped up in the full world of the professional bartender. I hope this podcast and site are a help for anyone looking to have some fun with drinks at home.
